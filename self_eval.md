# Self-Evaluation

1. Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
- This definitely took more time and effort to get a grasp of than other topics that we have covered up until now. I was really proud that I was able to complete all of the work without having to do too much research.

2. What is the power of using methods in our applications?
- Methods allow us to establish prebuilt systems that simplify and streamline code that we will use repeatedly, thereby accelerating workflow and efficiency.
